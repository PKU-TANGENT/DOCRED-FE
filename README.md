# DocRED-FE
Dataset and code for baselines for "DOCRED-FE: A DOCUMENT-LEVEL FINE-GRAINED ENTITY AND RELATION EXTRACTION DATASET"[IEEE eXpress](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10095786), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11141)

Joint entity and relation extraction (JERE) is one of the most
important tasks in information extraction. However, most
existing works focus on sentence-level coarse-grained JERE,
which have limitations in real-world scenarios. In this pa-
per, we construct a large-scale document-level fine-grained
JERE dataset DocRED-FE, which improves DocRED with
Fine-Grained Entity Type. Specifically, we redesign a hierar-
chical entity type schema including 11 coarse-grained types
and 119 fine-grained types, and then re-annotate DocRED
manually according to this schema. Through comprehensive
experiments we find that:

+ DocRED-FE is challenging to existing JERE model.
+ Our fine-grained entity types promote relation classification.
